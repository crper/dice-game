/**
 * Core domain types for the 3D dice game.
 *
 * The game ships two modes:
 * - `liar` — 大话骰 / Liar's Dice: each seat keeps a hidden hand, players take
 *   turns raising a bid and may challenge ("open") the previous bid.
 * - `open` — 明牌 / Open Roll: a single hand is rolled in the open and the
 *   outcome is published immediately with a plain-language verdict.
